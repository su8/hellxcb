â†’ tiny(!) and monsterous!
----------------------
This is xcb port of monsterwm tiling window manager.
For more detailed README refer to [monsterwm][]

Installation
------------

You need xcb and xcb-utils then,
open up `config.h`
and edit to suit your needs.
Build and install.

    $ $EDITOR_OF_CHOICE config.h
    $ make -j8 # where 8 are CPU cores
    # make install

To have mouse cursor, open up `.xinitrc` and append somewhere before the `case` label the following `xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr`

The statusline in the picture above is made of https://github.com/su8/doomy . You can use `sed` to make a named tag/workspace from `/tmp/hellxcb.txt` , just use `cat /tmp/hellxcb.txt | sed -E 's/tag: 1/tag: web/g; s/tag: 2/:tag dev/g; s/tag: 3/tag: misc/g; s/tag: 4/tag: float/g'` and redirect it `/tmp/doomy.txt` if you use https://github.com/su8/doomy

The packages needed for example would be
`libxcb` `xcb-util` `xcb-util-wm` `xcb-util-keysym` `gcc` `make` `xorg` 

Bugs
----

I have fixed - https://github.com/Cloudef/monsterwm-xcb/issues/8 . When closing pop-up dialogs you must use `alt + z` to bring the focusing back to normal.

Fill bugs only on hellxcb, when you are sure the bug doesn't occur on [monsterwm][].
